Plug-Ins
===============
### What are plug-ins?

Plug-ins work just like how apps work on your iPhone or Android. They serve a very specific purpose:
to increase the functionality of your phone beyond what they were intended to do. For Arcadier’s
marketplaces, plug-ins do the same thing: marketplace owners install them to satisfy a specific
business need on top of Arcadier’s core product, for example:
* A real-time shipping cost estimator for inter-continental shipping routes
* A plug in that allows you to sell on your Instagram page in one click
* A plug in from another organization that allow integration of their product to ours, e.g.
Mailchimp and Arcadier
* A plug-in that changes the onboarding flow of merchants on a marketplace, tailored by the
requirements of its admin.

Plug-ins meet very specific needs for each marketplace and their owners are ready to pay for them if
it improves their business. A marketplace operator might want a super specific plug-in to be
available to him/her only – that plug-in would be a private one.

On the other hand, many marketplaces could be facing the same problem, so as an entrepreneurial
developer, you could create one which is available for everyone to buy – a regular plug-in.
This is where you, as a developer, come in with your technical expertise and provide those
marketplaces with the plug-ins marketplace owners demand. Create plug-ins, get paid, and build
your business by helping Arcadier’s customers build theirs.

If you are familiar with Arcadier’s custom codes, then you might think why not just use our custom
codes to implement all that. The reason is that plug-ins are more:
* **Secure** – Because they reside in Arcadier’s secure servers instead of client-side
* **Exclusive** – Private Apps can require authentication to be used and
* **Powerful** as they can change the:
  * Buyer’s interface  
  * Merchant’s interface  
  * Admin’s interface
  * Add totally new Pages to the marketplace
  * Change user flows
  
If you are not familiar with Arcadier’s system or creation of plug-in, then you have come to the right
place to learn all you need to become a plug-in developer.
