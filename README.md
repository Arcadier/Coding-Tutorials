If you are not familiar with Arcadierâ€™s system or creation of Plug-Ins, then you have come to the right
place to learn all you need to become a plug-in developer.
We have documentation on our:
* [API v2.0](https://apiv2.arcadier.com)
* [Front-end](https://api.arcadier.com)

We have Github repositories for:
* [Plug in demos](https://github.com/Arcadier/Plug-In-Demos)
* [Developer Community Support](https://github.com/Arcadier/Developer-Community-Support)
* [Tutorials and Guides](https://github.com/Arcadier/Tutorials)

And finally, to test and play with our system:
* [Our sandbox marketplaces](https://api.arcadier.com/get-started)

These little code snippets and their descriptions aim at showing you how to create *very* basic functions that are expected out of Plug-Ins, like
* Adding front-end changes to our pages
* Creating new pages
* Choosing the type of user you would like the code to execucte for
* Calling API's
* Storing data in back-end
* Fetching data from the back-end

Feel free to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V them or suggest improvement them through pull-requests. Our developers don't have ego issues.
